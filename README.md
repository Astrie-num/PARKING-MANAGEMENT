# Parking Management System

## Overview
The Parking Management System is an intelligent robotic project that detects car plate numbers, processes payments, and allows entry. 
Developed for a robotics course, it automates parking management using computer vision and Python scripting.

## Features
- Detects car plate numbers using image processing
- Handles payment processing
- Grants entry based on successful detection and payment
- Logs plate data for tracking

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: YOLO (e.g., yolov8n.pt)
- **Hardware**: Likely Arduino or similar for robotics
- **Other**: OpenCV, dataset files for training

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd parking-management-system

2.Install Dependencies

    pip install opencv-python numpy ultralytics

3.Run the System

    python car_entry.py

## Usage
Run the script to detect plates and process payments.
Check plates_log.csv for logged data.
